# Week 1 Idea 2/9
- As Professor Gilleran's TA for her OIM2000 course, I want to build an app that create seating charts for Babson classrooms
    - I need Professor Li's guidance on how to link a database to my Python, and what is the roadblocks in between coding the Python backend and making it into a working frontend
    - For iteration 2 of the project, it should be able to track attendance, participation, and other student class activities through clicking on their profile
