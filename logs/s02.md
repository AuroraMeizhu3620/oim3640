# Session 2 App Idea 1/22
Option 1: I want to create an app that help users with memorization of words or concepts for higher education or certification exams.

Option 2: I want to create an platform that serves as a fun (almost game-like) way for people to introduce each other to peers that works for both an online and in-person setting.
