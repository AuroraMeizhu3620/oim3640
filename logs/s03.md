# Session 3 Asynchronous Learning Notes 1/26
### What you set up today
- I added in the Jupyter notebook files into my GitHub repository folder. 
- I added another learning log to my GitHub repository.
  
### What you learned from reading Chapters 1 and 2
- I learned about the value types of string, floating-point, and integer in chapter 1. 
- Variables can represent all types of values, and we use state diagram to track what each variable represents on paper.
- Module contains pre-defined variables. You have to import the module to call those variables. There is a dot operator (.) between the module name to the left and the variable name on the right.
- You evaluate an expression while execute a statement.

### Things that feel unclear right now
- We learned that .py means python files, .md means markdown files. During the uploading process of the Jupyter notebooks, the files end with .ipynb. I assume that means jupyter notebook files. Is it always a slow learning process to learn about what does each file extension stand for? What is it like to switch between file extentions/file types? 
  
### Questions you have for next class
- There is an exercise code for chapter 1 "%xmode Verbose." My terminal identifies it as a syntax error.
