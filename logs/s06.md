# for function range(p1, p2, p3) 
- p1 = where it starts
- p2 = where it ends
- p3 = how to count (step size ad direction)

# escape char (\)
- treat characters within the range as normal characters
- useful in quotes

# Lists and .append
- if in [] square brakets, a list
- s = [1, 2, 3] forms a list
- s.append(n)
- output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# mutable vs. immutable
- int is immutable: a=3 ,b=a, a=4: a=4, b=3
- list is muttable: a=[1, 2], b=a, a.append(3): a=b=[1, 2, 3]

# python print()
- usually print('word') prints word/n, moving to next line
- if add print('word', end='') print('word'): wordword
